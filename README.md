# MatrixAnimator
Program used to generate code for the 8x8 Arduino MAX72XX matrix display based on drawn patterns and animations.


The VB program generates either a single line of bytes for use with the arduino code or an array of bytes for an animation. See the appropriate paste section in the arduino .ino file.
